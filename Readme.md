firmware for ESP8266 to count radiation events with a geiger-m√ºller-counter

Connect RadiationD-v1.1 (CAJOE) header P3-Gnd with ESP-Gnd, P3-5V with ESP-5V and P3-Vin with ESP-D2

Note: P3-Vin has 3.3V level on my board. Ideal for ESP8266, no level shifter needed. Strange pin name, but it really is the interrupt line (falling edge).
